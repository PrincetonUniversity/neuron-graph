# Understanding nemanode data
NemaNode data consists of:
- cell data
- connection data
- dataset data

## Dataset data
A dataset is associated with connections data, e.g. connections A,B, C are found in dataset D which represents a nematode specimen at a specific age.

- ```name```: name of the dataset
- ```id```: id of the dataset
- ```type```: region that the dataset captures.  one of 'head', 'tail', or 'complete'
- ```time```: the age of the specimen in hours e.g. 15
- ```visual_time```: time to represent visually for the app
- ```description```: description of the dataset
- ```axes```: anatomical origin of each axis
- ```datatypes```: comma-delimited connection types described in the dataset (e.g. "cs,gj,fc")
It represents a nematode specimen at a specific development stage.

## Neuron data
A representation of a nematode cell.
Each cell is represented with the following attributes:

- ```name```: neuron name (string) e.g. AWAL
- ```class```: neuron class (string) e.g. AWA
- ```nt```: neurotransmitter (string), where each character of the string represents a neurotransmitter type.  e.g. 'adg' means the cell has 'acetylcholine', 'dopamine', and 'GABA' neurotransmitter types.  Possible neurotransmitter types:
    - ```a```: acetylcholine
    - ```d```: dopamine
    - ```g```: GABA
    - ```l```: glutamate
    - ```o```: octopamine
    - ```s```: serotonin
    - ```t```: tyramine
    - ```u```: unknown
    - ```n```: nothing (e.g. muscles)
- ```typ```: type of the cell (string), where each character of the string represents a type.  e.g. 'sim' means the cell has the types 'sensory neuron', 'interneuron' and 'motor neuron'.  Possible types:
    - ```s```: sensory neuron
    - ```i```: interneuron
    - ```m```: motor neuron
    - ```n```: neuromodulative neuron
    - ```b```: muscle
    - ```''```: unknown
- ```emb```: whether the cell is embryonic (boolean), can be either 1 (embryonic) or 0 (post-embryonic)
- ```inhead```: whether the cell is in the head
- ```intail```: whether the cell is in the tail

## Connection data
A representation of a nematode cell connection.
Each connection is represented with the following attributes:

- ```pre```: name of pre-synaptic cell (string) e.g. AWAL
- ```post```: name of post-synaptic cell (string) e.g. RIML
- ```typ```: type of synaptic connection (int), can be either:
    ```0```: chemical synapse
    ```2```: electrical synapse (gap junction)
    ```4```: functional connection
- ```syn```: list of synapse weights (int list)
- ```ids```: each synapse has a unique ID. This data is currently not used.

Gap junction and chemical synapse weights are ignored.  Weight is inferred by the list size.  Functional connection strength can be positive or negative.  Values are summed to compute the weight.
