# FunCoNN (BETA)

Interactive map of functional connectivity measured by neural activtion in the
nematode _C. elegans_. Live at
[FunCoNN.princeton.edu](https://funconn.princeton.edu/).

FunCoNN is a [fork](https://github.com/zhenlab-ltri/NemaNode) of
[NemaNode](https://nemanode.org/) (NemaNode is reported in Witvliet et al.,
2021) that adds Functional Connectivity data from the [Leifer
Lab](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu) on top of the Chemical Synapse and Gap
Junction data generated by John White and the [Zhen](https://www.zhenlab.com),
[Samuel](https://scholar.harvard.edu/aravisamuel), and
[Lichtman](https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu) labs.

The functional connectivity data measured by neural activation is reported in:
[Randi, Sharma, Dvali and Leifer, “A neural signal propagation atlas of
Caenorhabditis elegans.” Nature,
(2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4).
