# FunCoNN (BETA)

Interactive map of functional connectivity measured by neural activtion in the nematode _C. elegans_. Live at [FunCoNN.princeton.edu](https://funconn.princeton.edu/).

FunCoNN is a fork of [NemaNode](https://nemanode.org/) (NemaNode is reported in Witvliet et al., 2021) that adds Functional Connectivity data from the [Leifer Lab](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu) on top of the Chemical Synapse and Gap Junction data generated by the [Zhen](https://www.zhenlab.com), [Samuel](https://scholar.harvard.edu/aravisamuel), and [Lichtman](https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu) labs.

The f unctional connectivity data measured by neural activation is reported in: [Francesco Randi, Anuj K. Sharma, Sophie Dvali, Andrew M. Leifer, "A functional connectivity atlas of C. elegans measured by neural activation." arXiv:2208.04790 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.04790).

The project repositories, where you can peruse the code, request features, and report bugs are both located on GitHub:
- [FunCoNN (BETA)](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/neuron-graph) (this project)
- [NemaNode](https://github.com/zhenlab-ltri/NemaNode) (original project)

This project is in beta and has not yet been peer reviewed. Data and code are released under a permissive license at https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/neuron-graph/

This fork is developed by Research Computing staff in the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics (Robert Leach and Lance Parsons) and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (Benjamin Singer). Request features or report bugs on Github.
